# Advanced-Graphics-OpenGL

## To Do:
### Coursework part A – Standard Features:

You must implement the following set of basic features:

- The scene must include a landscape of some form, rendered such that at least one texture is used in the fragment shader.

- Part of the scene must be lit using at least one light source, including calculations for ambient, diffuse and specular components.
- Part of the scene must show use of environment mapping.
- The camera should initially move automatically through the scene.
- The scene should be controlled via an overall scene graph for efficient rendering.
- Appropriate usage of simple meshes and textures to combine into additional scene elements.

### Coursework part B - Advanced Features:

You are free to develop your own advanced ideas for enhancing the visuals of the coursework – you are not limited to this example list. Ask if you are unsure about the suitability of your idea, or want hints on how your idea could be achieved. The more complex, and well-engineered an effect is, the higher the mark that will be awarded.

- Post processing effects: Blurring, colour correction, lens flare, HDR bloom effects etc. These may be applied to specific parts of the camera track, or optionally via keypresses.
- Advanced Lighting: Inclusion of new light calculations such as spot lights, projective lighting, or alternate methods of calculating the contribution of a large number of lights.
- Shadowing: Part of the scene must demonstrate the use of real time shadowing techniques. Use of multiple shadow maps, cascaded shadow maps, or omnidirectional shadow maps via cube mapping are considered more technically advanced.
- Multiple viewpoints simultaneously using a split screen effect.
- Animated objects (skeletal animation, a progressively evolving tree mesh, grass waving in the wind).
- Environmental effects such as rain, splashing puddles, lightning strikes, or fire.


## Marks Available:
### Coursework Part A (50 marks)

Implementation of the standard features gains up to 50 marks.
A “first class” submission consists of these features implemented with well-structured code, running at 60fps in full screen on the lab PC.
### Coursework Part B (50 marks)

Implementations of advanced rendering techniques (including, but not limited to, the features described above) gain up to 50 marks.
A “first class” submission entails a balanced scene of graphical effects including at least four advanced graphical features (well implemented and integrated with the standard features), running at a minimum of 60fps in full-screen mode. The code should be clearly formatted.
